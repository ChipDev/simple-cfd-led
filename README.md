ðŸš€Fluid sim -> To be implemented on 10x10 or larger led matrix

Original project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAVRgIrUOU&ab_channel=TenMinutePhysics 
From TenMinutePhysics

Converted code from JS to C++ to then be put on ESP32 or Arduino


First, I have to make it run fast & be pretty. More so to be beautiful. That's the point.
